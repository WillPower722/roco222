# **Command line**

$ ls displays list of folders on OS  
$ cd /tmp changes the '-' in front of the '$' to '/tmp'  
$ cd $HOME changes back to '-'  
$ mkdlr opens the directory for the terminalusing a keyword (eg mkdlr --help)  
$ echo "Hello" > hello.md writes "Hello" to hello.md file  
$ cat hello.md calls "Hello" on the next line  
$ cp hello.md hello-again.md copies hello.md to hello-again.md  
$ mv hello-again.md hello-hello.md moves hello-again.md file to hello-hello.md  
$ rm hello.md removes the file  
$ rm -rf removes all files (with permission) and all recursive files  
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo displays all info on the CPU

# **DC motor build**

### **Components**

* Commutator: The commutator is the two adhesive copper strips attatched to the cork which, when voltage is applied, will periodically flip the current direction allowing the motor to rotate.
* Brush: the brush is a peice of metal that is not attached to the motor directly, but while the motor rotates the brush will remain stationary and make contact with the two peices of copper tape (Commutator) which will cause the flow of current to flip.
* Magnets: the powerful magnets pull on the magnetic feild generated by the wires which, because the magnetic feilds flip, allows the commutator to rotate.
Copper wire: We used 75 turns of copper wire for the coil.

### **Improvements**

* Comutator: We changed the commutator to have 4 strips of copper tape and 2 coils of copper wire with 60 turns each to improve the electro-magnetic field and to allow the magnets to have a greater affect on the motor. We also added an extra block of cork to the body to create more support for the copper strips.
* Brush: we swapped the wire we were using from a single length of metal to a wire with multiple frayed wires for more consistent contact with the copper strips.

# **Incremental encoder**

### **Build**

For the incremental encoder we built a disc out of thick paper, cut a quarter out of it and attached it to our motor with blue tac. Next we built the encoder using an infared transmitter and an infared receiver and put it either side of the disc.
We then used the arduino board to connect to the encoder and pogrammed the board so that every time the infared receiver measures a rising pulse, we increment a variable by 1.

### **Testing**

We ran the the motor after uploading the code to the board and ran the program for 20 seconds and multipied the result by 3; we did this 3 times to get an avrage of about 10,000 rpm which seems to be too high so we will need to calibrate our design to aquire a more reasonable value.

# **Robot Arm Project**

## **Servo motor control**

Using the example Arduino code we managed to quickly work out how to control the servo motor after some trial and error with delay times. Here is the code we came up with:

void setup(){
  
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

**void loop(){
 
 **int potValue = analogRead(A0); //reads the potentiometer value
 
 **int timing = 400 + (potValue * 2); //this value can range from the smallest delay the motor can read, to the largest

 **digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
 
 **delayMicroseconds(timing);
 
 **digitalWrite(9, LOW);

 **delay(10);
}

This code only controls one motor and we will be using 2 in the project.

## **Arm Design**

For the arm we will only have 2 axis of movement so we are going to make an arm that moves back and forth and grab things with a claw. We are going for a small arm design to keep it lightweight and efficient; the 3D print material shoud be strong enough so that the arm doesnt bend or break.
